                        <span class="que">Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? What did you discover in your research?</span>
                        <p class="ans">The term Responsive Design means that the displayed HTML file by using HTML, CSS, Javascript and else to respond according to the size of the device. It is not just the size of the device such as computers, mobiles, tablets, kiosks or other devices. It also should be considered the direction of device. The displayed page should be good to use for users in depends on the environment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="q2">
                        <span class="que">How does responsive design relate to web technologies? How can web pages take advantage of it?</span>
                        <p class="ans">In my opinion, the first thing is efficiency. Nowadays, people are surrounded by technical devices. Not just personal devices like desktop, cellphone and tablets, they are using a kiosk for managing the products and touch screens for finding the direction. And because of this diversity, the Web page should be managed. For example, one Web page can be shown at a mobile, tablet, desktop and else for each device in right way, with one HTML file, then it will save time, money and others.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li id="q3">
                        <span class="que">What techniques, technologies, and patterns did you use in your responsive design?</span>
                        <p class="ans">I mostly used the media query that reacts to the size of the width of the device in the CSS. In CSS, I divided with the common part, max-width 1023px for mobile devices such as cellphone and tablet and min-width 1024px for the bigger screens such as kiosk and desktop, three parts of the CSS method. The common parts for reset the basic CSS rules and using the common CSS part for the site. Except two parts are divided for each size and ratio. In the desktop CSS part, the design is a layered design as header, navigation, contents and footers. In the mobile parts in the CSS are changed for the vertical design for an easy scroll for users.</p>

                   <li id="q4">
                        <span class="que">What did you learn about building web apps for different devices?</span>
                        <p class="ans">The designer and the developer should think about the user environment for the Web page. As I mentioned, these days people are using different devices and designers and developers should be managed for the user. I just used media query, however, they are lots of methods to build web page or app.</p>
